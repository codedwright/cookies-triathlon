			<h4 class="subheader q">Is there a cost to participate?</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 columns">
			<p><b>Yes. There is a $25 fee per participant entry to cover expenses.</b></p>
			<p>What expenses? Bike racks, course signage and markers, lots of equipment, the large inflatable arch at the finish line, a nice high quality tee and some other schwag. Importantly, this race is sanctioned by USA Triathlon which will provide insurance for each participant. The modest fee of $25 each makes all of this possible. </p>
			<p>Please bring the exact amount the day of the event to be paid at registration. If you prepay in advance you can receive a full refund if you can't attend. <i>Note: If you are already a USA Triathlon member you can save $12 off the normal $25 if you show your valid and current membership card since your membership already covers you for any USA Triathlon sanctioned events.</i></p>

			<h4 class="subheader q">Do I have to be an "athlete" to participate?</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 columns">
			<p><b>Not at all. While the course is challenging, each stage is a distance that almost anyone can complete.</b> Each year we see a wide range of ages, fitness levels and body types out on the course and everyone has a good time. So come challenge yourself and be encouraged by the cheers of your brothers and sisters. </p>
			<p>This event is all about encouraging one another, setting a goal, and improving our health and fitness so that we can achieve it. Check your ego at the door and don't worry about being faster than others. Just focus on exceeding what you think you're capable of doing and setting your own personal best. And, most of all, come to have fun.</p>

		<div class="large-4 medium-4 small-12 columns">
			<h4 class="subheader q">How much should I train?</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 columns">
			<p>Like most things, the more you put into it, the more you'll get out of it. Ideally you'd want to fit a run and a bike ride into your weekly routine. Keep in mind, however, that "physical training is beneficial for a little, but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and the life that is to come." (1 Timothy 4:8). So your family responsibilities and spirituality must come first.</p>
			<p><b>Our goal is not to encourage people to become obsessed with racing and fitness.</b> Rather, we hope that many friends devote a <i>reasonable</i> amount of time to fitness over the summer and adopt a love for exercise and healthy eating that they continue indefinitely &mdash; whether they get into racing or not.</p>

			<h4 class="subheader q">I'm kind of competitive &mdash; any awards for the winners?</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 columns">
			<p>OK, for those that are athletic and really get into this kind of stuff, you'll find plenty of contenders for the top spots. And while everyone is a winner just for participating, we do award trophies for the fastest female, fastest male, and fastest team. (If Trent Prough shows up, you might as well call it day.)</p>

		<div class="large-4 medium-4 small-12 columns">
			<h4 class="subheader q">What equipment do I need?</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 columns">
			<p><b>REQUIRED:</b> Swimming trunks, a bicycle that is in good running condition, a bicycle helmet, and running shoes.</p>
			<p><b>RECOMMENDED:</b> Road bike, sunscreen, water bottles, nutrition supplements, a swim cap and/or goggles, towels.</p>
			<p><b>IDEAL:</b> See our equipment page for details about getting outfitted for a triathlon.</p>

			<h4 class="subheader q">I don't own a bike!</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 columns">
			<p>Borrow one from a friend. You can also rent a bike. Check with your local bike shop. We know <a href="http://fwoutfitters.com">Fort Wayne Outfitters</a> rents road bikes.</p>
			<p>Any kind of bike will do the trick. If you can get one that has smoother road tires that would be preferred (as opposed to knobby mountain bike tires). Road bikes are ideal.</p>

		<div class="large-4 medium-4 small-12 columns">
			<h4 class="subheader q">Will I change clothes between stages?</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 columns">
			<p><b>No. In a Triathlon you do not change clothes between activities &mdash; you wear the same base gear throughout the race and just change your shoes.</b> In fact, part of the challenge of these races is being able to "transition" as quickly as possible from one stage to the next.</p>
			<p>Most tri-athletes wear form-fitting shirts and shorts that are designed to be worn through all three stages and dry quickly after getting wet. Many sports shops carry this gear and the prices can vary widely.</p>
			<p>Do you need this stuff to race? No, just wear something that can get wet and will be comfortable for all three stages. Avoid baggy clothes that will create drag in the water or on a bike. In any case, please be modest.</p>

			<h4 class="subheader q">What about safety and liability?</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 columns">
			<p><b>We make every effort to ensure the safety of every participant with good signage, lifeguards, race marshals, etc. Please keep in mind, however, that there are inherent dangers to swimming and running and cycling on open roads. These dangers are amplified in a competitive environment with lots of people.</b></p>
			<p><img align="right"  src="img/logos/sponsor_USAT_2.jpg">
<b>We encourage as many as possible to participate, but you must know your physical health and capabilities. If you choose to participate in this event you assume <i>all</i> liability and responsibility for your decisions, health and safety.</b> This race is sanctioned by USA Triathlon which will provides some level insurance for each participant. You will be required to sign a release at registration the day of the race; Jeff & Lori Cook, the race sponsors, nor any volunteers or organizers are responsible or liable.</p>			
			<p>For friends and family who come to watch, please keep an eye on your little ones! The pond, woods and roadway are all dangerous areas where little kids could get lost, injured or even killed.</p>
